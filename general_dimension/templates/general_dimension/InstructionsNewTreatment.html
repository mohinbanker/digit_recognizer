            In this game, objects have no sub-prices.  That is, sellers will set a single price and buyers will pay sellers a single price.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make clear how this works, we will go over differences in the seller and buyer roles.

            <p>
                In this game, the price of an object is made up of “sub-prices”. A sub-price is a part of the total price.  Sellers will choose values for each sub-price, and buyers will pay sellers the sum of all the sub-prices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Buyers will not see the total price &mdash; instead, buyers will only see the sub-prices before they make their choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this game, each object has {{ subsession.dims }} sub-prices.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make clear how this works, we will explain both roles in detail.
            </p>

            <p>
                As before, sellers will choose values for all sub-prices, and buyers will pay sellers the sum of all the sub-prices.
