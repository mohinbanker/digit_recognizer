                        A buyer earns tokens by buying an object from a seller and then giving it to the experimenter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experimenter gives {{ Constants.consbenefit }} tokens for an object.
                    </p><p>
                        When you are a buyer, your only job is to choose from which seller you want to buy an object.
                    </p>

                        As a buyer, after you choose a seller, you will pay the seller the seller's price.

                <p>
                    To the right is an example of a buyer's interface.
                </p>

            </section>
            {% if subsession.dims > 1 %}
                <section>
                    <p>
                        As you can see in the example interface, if you are a buyer, you will not see the sellers’ total prices.  Instead, you will see their sub-prices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you choose a seller, you will pay the seller the sum of the seller’s sub-prices (the total price).
                    </p>
                </section>
            {% endif %}
            {% if subsession.round_number == 1 %}
                <section>
                    <p>
                        After you buy an object, you will automatically give the object to the experimenter and get {{ Constants.consbenefit }} tokens.
                    </p><p>
                        Other than the price, it does not matter which seller you choose &mdash; the sellers' objects are the same in every way.
                    </p>
                </section>
            {% endif %}
            <section>
                <p>
                    Therefore, accounting for everything, within a given round, you will gain {{ Constants.consbenefit }} tokens and lose the {{ subsession.dims | pluralize:"price,total price" }} you pay for the object.
                </p><p>
                    Before continuing, please choose a seller in the example interface to the right.
                </p>
